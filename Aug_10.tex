\section{Compiler and Interpreter}

\begin{itemize}
    \item A compiler is a software or program that translates programs from a source language to a target language so that both programs are equivalent during run-time.
    \item An interpreter is a language processor that directly executes the instructions from the source language and gives the output directly, skipping the translation process in comparison to a compiler.

    \subsection{Analogy â€” Language translation}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Imagine you write a book in French and your audience speaks English.

        \item \textbf{Compiler approach:}

        You hire a translator who translates the entire book into English, prints it, and hands it to your audience. \\ 

        Once done, the audience can read it anytime without the translator. \\

        \textbf{Drawback}: takes time before anyone can start reading.

        \item \textbf{Interpreter approach:}

        You hire a translator to stand next to the audience and read your French book aloud, translating sentence-by-sentence in real time. \\

        People can start hearing the story right away. \\

        \textbf{Drawback}: the translator must be there every time, and real-time translation is often slower.
    \end{itemize}

    \item There are hybrid use-cases of both compilers and interpreters. For example, Java compiles the program into bytecode and then the intermediate program is then interpreted (line-by-line by execution). These bytecodes are interpreted by a virtual machine. Its application being that it can be compiled in one computer and can then be interpreted across a network.

    \item There are some Java compilers called "Just-In-Time" (JIT) compilers which try to improve the interpretation of bytecodes by directly translating portions of a program which occur more frequently than other parts (also called \textit{hotspots}) into native machine code to save time when its run the next time.

    \item The name comes from considering the phase at which it compiles the program. A compiler compiles the entire program into assembly (or some low-level language) before being executed. In this case, the compilation takes place during the interpretation and its only done for chunks which are repetitive.
